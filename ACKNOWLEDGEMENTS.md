Granary's original implementation (not contained in this source code repository) was primarily
written by [Peter Goodman](https://github.com/pgoodman) and [Akshay Kumar](https://github.com/kumarak). That implementation was based on DynamoRIO Kernel (DRK).
The main author or DRK was [Peter Feiner](https://github.com/peterfeiner).

Advisors of the Granary project include [Angela Demke Brown](https://github.com/demkebrown) and [Ashvin Goel](https://github.com/ashvingoel).

## DynamoRIO
Granary depends on the instruction encoder, decoder, intermediate representation, and various
instruction manipulation APIs of DynamoRIO. Please see [DynamoRIO's acknowledgements document](https://code.google.com/p/dynamorio/source/browse/trunk/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS)
for the authors of the DynamoRIO components of Granary.

## MurmurHash
Granary uses Austin Appleby's MurmurHash as a hashing routine.

## Itanium C++ ABI
Granary uses some of the code from [OSDev.org's Itanium C++ ABI implementation](http://wiki.osdev.org/C++).
